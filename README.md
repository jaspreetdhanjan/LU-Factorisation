# LU-Factorisation
Computational Mathematics 2 Assignment -- performing LU decomposition to solve a linear system of equations in the form Ax=b.

This assignment was composed of four main stages.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: Forward substitution of function Ly=b</li>
  <li>Stage 2: Backward substitution of function Ux=y</li>
  <li>Stage 3: Factorisation of matrix A=LU</li>
  <li>Stage 4: Combining above to find the solution to Ax=b</li>
</ul>
