# LU-Factorisation
Computational Mathematics 2 Assignment -- performing LU decomposition to solve a linear system of equations in the form Ax=b.

This assignment was composed of four main stages.

Stage 1: Forward substitution of function Ly=b
Stage 2: Backward substitution of function Ux=y
Stage 3: Factorisation of matrix A=LU
Stage 4: Combining above to find the solution to Ax=b
